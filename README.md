# LoSt
Simple localStorage wrapper

This is a little module in JavaScript to pretend work with localStorage easyer. Is based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2010892/storing-objects-in-html5-localstorage thread, is inperfect and I need help to to improve. I did not want to use the existing libraries because are big and I like small and simple.
